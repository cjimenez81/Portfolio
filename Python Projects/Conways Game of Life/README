# This program is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life. From Wikipedia:
# "The game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined
# by its initial state, requiring no further input."
#
# The user defines the size of the game board, the number of turns, and which
# cells to turn on to be the game's initial state. They have the option to 
# view every iteration of the game board or only the first and last iterations.
