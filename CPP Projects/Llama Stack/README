# README
# This folder contains the files for Llama Stack implementation. Llama Stack stands for
# Linked List Array Mixed Amalgamation Stack. The purpose of this data structure is to
# provide a dynamically sized stack for holding data. Each node of the linked list contains
# an array segment of the stack. When he current node is full, a new node is allocated 
# with the new 'top' array segment of the stack. The output.txt file contains the text
# that is produced when the program is run on a Unix command line.
